### USE A DEBUGGER ###

# Most IDEs (Intelligent Development Environments) such as PyCharm will have built-in tools for debugging.
# This is normally known as the debugger. In many ways, they are like print statements on steroids.

# Debuggers allows us to peek into our code during execution and pause on chosen lines to figure out what is the inner mechanism and where it's going wrong.

# There are a couple of things that are the same in most IDEs which you should be familiar with:
    # Breakpoint - You can set a breakpoint by clicking on a line in the gutter of the code (where the line numbers are). This line will be where the program pauses during debug run.
    # Step Over - This button will go through the execution of your code line by line and allow you to view the intermediate values of your variables.
    # Step Into - This will enter into any other modules that your code references. e.g. If you use a function from the random module it will show you the original code for that function so you can better understand its functionality and how it relates to your problems.
    # Step Into My Code - This does the same thing as Step Into, but it limits the scope to your own project code and ignores library code such as random.

## PAUSE 1
# Use the PyCharm debugger to figure out what is the issue in the starting code and fix it.
