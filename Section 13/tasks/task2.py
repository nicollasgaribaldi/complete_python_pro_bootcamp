### REPRODUCE THE BUG ###

# Some bugs are sneaky, they only occur under certain conditions.
# In order to debug them, we need to be able to reliably reproduce the bug and diagnose our problem to figure out which conditions trigger the bug.

## PAUSE 1
# Change the code so that it always produces the occasional error.

## PAUSE 2
# Fix the code and remove the bug.
