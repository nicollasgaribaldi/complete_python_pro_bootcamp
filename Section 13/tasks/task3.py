# You need to be able to go through your code line by line as if you were the computer to help you figure out what is going wrong.

## PAUSE 1
# Play computer and go through the code line by line as if you were executing the code to figure out why 1994 does not work as expected.
# Then go ahead and fix the code.

year = int(input("What's your year of birth?"))

if year >= 1980 and year <= 1994:
    print("You are a millennial.")
elif year > 1994:
    print("You are a Gen Z.")
