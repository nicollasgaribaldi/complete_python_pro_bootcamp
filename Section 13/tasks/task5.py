### USE PRINT ###

# print() is your friend. It can help expose hidden values while your code is running.
# In a for loop, the loop will follow some rules to perform a repeated block of code.
# But during the loop it's difficult to see the intermediate values, that's a perfect example of how you can use print to expose those intermediate values and help you debug your code.

## PAUSE 1
# The code is supposed to calculate the total number of words given the number pages and the word per page.
# But it's not currently giving any output. Diagnose the problem using print() statements.

## PAUSE 2
# Fix the code.

word_per_page = 0
pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
word_per_page = int(input("Number of words per page: "))
total_words = pages * word_per_page
print(total_words)
