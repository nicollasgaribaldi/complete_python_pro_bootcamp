### DEBUGGING LEAP YEAR ###

    # - Read the code in exercise.py
    # - Spot the problems üêû.
    # - Modify the code to fix the program.   

# Fix the code so that it works and when you hit submit it should pass all the tests. 

# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

    # - on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
    # - except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
    # - unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

# You can paste the code into PyCharm to help you debug.

    if year % 4 == 0:
        if year % 100 == 0:
            if year % 400 == 0: # Removed one '0' 
                return True
