### DEBUGGING FIZZ BUZZ ###

# - Read the code in exercise.py
# - Spot the problems üêû. 
# - Modify the code to fix the program. 
# - No shortcuts 

# - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a previous working solution.   

# The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.   
# - Your program should print each number from 1 to x where x is the input number. 
# - However when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".   
# - When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz". 
# - And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".

# Target is the number up to which we count

        elif number % 3 == 0:
